## Getting Started

-   Fork it.

-   Clone your forked repo and move inside it:

`git clone https://github.com/IEEE-VIT/hangman-react.git && cd hangman-react`

-   Checkout to a new branch to work on an issue:

`git checkout -b my-amazing-feature`

-   Setup

1. To setup this project, simply run the following command:

```bash
$ yarn install
```

or

```bash
$ npm install
```

It should create a `node_modules` folder, and you're good to go! :)

2. All the components are setup inside `hangman/src/components`. Most of your code should go there.

3. To start the project, simply run the following command:

```bash
$ yarn start
```

or

```bash
$ npm start
```

-   Once you're all done coding, it's time to open a PR :)
    Run the following commands from the root of the project directory:

`git add .`

`git commit -m "A short description about the feature."`

`git push origin <my-amazing-feature>`
